# Intergalactic Mogger

In Intergalactic Mogger, you play out as a weak nerd with blue skin from the planet Rizzerus. You are living peacefully when suddenly another alien species with purple skin, called the Looksmaxxers, invades your planet, and you are forced to protect your home. Your objective is to defeat all of the Looksmaxxer soldiers, and defeat the leader of their species called Leahun. 

You can move around the atmosphere of your planet by using WASD, but are limited to a small areas of the atmosphere that you can survive in. You can shoot the Looksmaxxers with a laser activated by pressing your spacebar. On your home planet, killing is called 'mogging'. You level up after defeating each wave of the Looksmaxxers, and get progressively more handsome and your physical appearance changes, but the amount of enemies you have to defeat increases as well. You are limited to 3 lives, but once you get hit three times by the lasers of the Looksmaxxers, it is game over. You can press the try again button to restart the game and try again. The start menu also consists of three buttons: the start button, options, and the 'how to play' button. The options allows you to adjust the sound of the background music and laser shooting noise. The 'how to play' button directs you to another page of the menu consisting of a small summary of the story and the controls for the game. Once you defeat the game, the screen displays your final sprite, with the strongest muscles and coolest appearance. You end the game as the "Intergalactic Mogger", able to mog the whole universe with your appearance alone.
